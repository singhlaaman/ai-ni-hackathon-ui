The helplines provide a variety of vital support services including, information, advice, counselling, a listening ear and be-friending, and offer immediate support to those with a wide-range of health and wellbeing needs, often for those who are the most vulnerable in our community. Many of the services take place over the phone, but some can help via email, text and in some cases with live web-chat. </CardText>
